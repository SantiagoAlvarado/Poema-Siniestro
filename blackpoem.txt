Not so sinister poem

The sky is black
The flower are black
My soul is black
My dog is black

My pony is black
My USB is black
Denzel Washington is black
The universe is obscure

The stars come black
A heroe is coming back
 To fight with the Darkside
And return to the lightside

But the rainbow is still full of colors.

The end
